# Shake!FM Telegram Bot

## First I wanna thank a few people

Thanks to [@atipugin](https://github.com/atipugin/) for his excellent example of a [Telegram ruby bot](https://github.com/atipugin/telegram-bot-ruby/blob/master/examples/bot.rb). This example helped me to develop this bot in no time.

As this is **my first productive Telegram bot** I hope it will get better and more useful from time to time.

By creating this bot I also wanna show my love for [Shake!FM](https://www.shake.fm/). I hope it will help this **great advertisement-less** radio station to gain more listeners in the future as I really like their program. Keep up the good work guys :-)

So just **support the guys at Shake!FM** if you like their program: [shakefm.de/unterstuetzen/](https://www.shakefm.de/unterstuetzen/)

## Warranty

I'm just a listener and regular supporter so this is an **inofficial community project** which is **not related to Shake!FM or any of their representatives**.

## Usage

You can find the bot at [t.me/@shakefm_bot](https://t.me/shakefm_bot) and add it to your Telegram profile by visiting the link and starting the bot by sending him the command `/start`.

## Commands

`/start` - This starts the bot  
`/current_track` - Shows the current track  
`/current_playlist` - Shows the last five tracks  
`/play` - Shows the url to tune into the radio stream Shake!FM  
`/tv` - Shows the url to tune into the video stream of Shake!FM  
`/contact` - Shows contact info  
`/social` - Shows social media channels  
`/stop` - This stops the bot

## How it works

At the moment everything is hardcoded into the ruby script except the playlist information. This is extracted from the json api which is available here: [api.shakefm.de/playlist/](https://api.shakefm.de/playlist/)

## Issues, Comments and more

If you have any suggestions just drop me a message or open an issue here at GitHub.

## Other repositories

I'm planning to host this repository also on Codeberg. I will post the url here when this is done.
